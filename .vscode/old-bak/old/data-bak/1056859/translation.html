<div><h3>The year 602, second entry</h3><p><span>We come back to what we forgot: in 602 of the Armenian era a king of 18 years sat in Jerusalem.</span> <span>the son of Kontanj [Fulk of Anjou] king of the Franks. Taking him in hand, the great God gave him a great victory:</span> <span> to rule over the impregnable, inaccessible, and un-Christian town of Askalon,</span> <span>for which the noble Frankish race patiently endured many difficulties,</span> <span>together with the good and holy king, for a year.</span> <span>And several of them became worthy of the martyr's crown, as well as no small number of the Brothers.</span> <span>Then after these tribulations, the intercessor and hope of the Christians, the Mother of God, prayed to our Lord Jesus Christ that he finally bring [them] victory on account of their patience in suffering.</span> <span>And the city was given into the hands of the king and the Brothers on the day of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin by her intercession.</span> <span>After this, finding treachery from the infidel race of the Scyths,</span> <span>until the philanthropic king fed a countless number of them to the sword, those filled with the blood of the Christians.</span> <span>And he removed the others, making them live outside the city.</span> <span>And instead of un-Christian voices the voice of the life-giving Gospel could be heard in all places.</span> <span>They erected the redeeming cross on all the tall buildings for the shame and humiliation of all the degenerate, dark, and wicked nations.</span> <span>indeed for us, to the pride and joy of the faithful.</span> <span>Then after this great and wondrous victory, stopping a while to rest,</span> <span>they also began to make plans for the city of Damascus.</span> <span>For at the beginning of 603 of the era, the son of Zengi, the lord of Aleppo, came and wished to rule Damascus as fraudulently.</span> <span>although the citizens did not want this out of fear for their sons, whom they had sent as hostages to Jerusalem out of submission to the will of the king.</span> <span>And, entering the city with a ruse, he ruled Damascus.</span></p></div>
