<div><h3>The year 546, continued</h3><p><span>In this year a frightful and wondrous sign appeared in the sky to the north;</span> <span>no one had ever seen such a marvellous sign.</span> <span>In the month of Mareri the sight burned its fiery flame in the sky,</span> <span>and reddened sharply in the clear sky.</span> <span>And the heavens were bound in mounds (???)</span> <span>and became aflame in all sorts of colors and appeared flowing in the east and gathered/rose went to pieces and covered most of the sky,</span> <span>very red in color and marvelous,</span> <span>it reached up to the vault of the heavens.</span> <span>The wise and clever ones warned/declared this,</span> <span>and they said that this is a sign of bloodshed.</span> <span>Indeed in this manner evil slaughter and terror happened in this manner,</span> <span>of which we wrote a little in this work.</span></p></div>
