<div><h3>The year 600 (12 February 1151â€“11 February 1152)</h3><p><span>Now in 600 of the Armenian era red snow came to the country of Jahan in the month of Nawasard,</span> <span>on the 23rd of the month.</span> <span>And on the same day when red snow came there, white snow mixed with ashes came in the Christian lands like in the past year.</span> <span>Then after all this the army and citizens who were in Tell Bashir were bearing half-patiently the tribulations which were written [about].</span> <span>When the son of Zengi, who was lord of Aleppo, learned of this, he came with an army against them.</span> <span>and because they did not have their alliances from anywhere.</span> <span>Having made an oath of confirmation they willingly gave up their fortress Tell Bashir.</span> <span>And the Christians,</span> <span>who there were Franks or Armenians, would wish to go to Antioch or another place.</span> <span>They would be taken harmlessly by order of Nur ad-Din, which indeed he did in this way, and sultan Masud and Malik his son did likewise out of desire for the lands,</span> <span>which they took easily from the Christians.</span> <span>And it was not because of their faith or friendship that they had toward the Christians.</span></p></div>
