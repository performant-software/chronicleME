<div><h3>The year 570 (19 February 1121–18 February 1122)</h3><p><span>Then this thing happened in 570 of this Armenian era – a certain emir from the country of Ganjak named Ghazi,</span> <span>a murderous, insolent and evil rogue,</span> <span>was adjacent to the land of the Georgians and was willingly in vassalage to the Georgian king David. </span> <span>And in this year he thought of an evil plan; taking 30,000 Turkish soldiers Ghazi entered the Georgian country and took a part captive and removed [them] from the Georgian land and went and encamped in his territory.</span> <span>When David the Georgian king heard this, he also sent a Georgian army to the country</span> <span>and, coming in secret, fell upon the Turkish army.</span> <span>He slaughtered 30,000 of their men and captured all their wives and sons and innumerable flocks of sheep, together with great and uncountable booty, and they led them to the country of Georgia.</span> <span>Then the remainder of the Turkish army in severe danger tore their clothes and threw ashes upon their heads and wearing black clothes and with bare heads became [did|went] wailing to their sultan in Ganjak city to Malik the son of Tap'ar</span> <span>and, weeping, they raised an appeal before him about their destruction.</span> <span>Others reached the district of the Arab land Kerman, to the emir Ghazi the son of Artukh and bitterly weeping told him [about] the extremity of their destruction; </span> <span>and he in his strength and arrogance ordered there to be a collection of a multitude of his armies, all the Turkish people, from the Greek lands up to the east and all Kerman,</span> <span>His armies numbered 150,000 and he sent word to the southern land of the Arabs and called to him the king of the Arabs who was called Sagha the son of Tupais, who came to him with 10,000.</span> <span>This one was a brave and warlike man;</span> <span>he captured the city of Baghdad and he won three battles against Tap'ar the Persian sultan,</span> <span>who was vanquished.</span> <span>He was of the Rafidhi people and a great blasphemer of Muhammad and all his institutions. </span> <span>He [had] made camp with his tents in the middle of Ethiopia and in India,</span> <span>and at this time he came to become a son-in-law to il-Ghazi the Persian emir.</span> <span>And in this year Ghazi marched with a multitude of troops and reached the land of Ganjak, going against the land of the Georgians.</span> <span>Then Sultan Malik came to Ganjak with 400,000 mounted warriors, marching with a fearful multitude, and they entered the Georgian land in the region of the city of Tiflis at the mountain called Didgori.</span> <span>When David the Georgian king, son of Bagrat, son of Georgi, heard this, he arrived to battle against the Turkish armies with 40,000 men, skillful and brave and practiced in warfare.</span> <span>He also had another army from the Kipchak king, 15,000 brave and choice men,</span> <span>and 500 men from the Alans and 100 Franks; and on the 13th of the month of August and on the feast of the Assumption, a Thursday, there was a violent battle between the two mountains, so that the mountains cried out frightfully from the noise of the armies.</span> <span>And then help arrived from God for the Georgian army, and in joining battle they put all the Turkish troops to flight;</span> <span>and on that day there was a severe and frightful slaughter of the Turkish soldiers, and the rivers and valleys of the mountains were filled with corpses and all the rocky mountain ledges were covered with them.</span> <span>The number of slaughtered Turkish soldiers came to 400,000 and 30,000 men were captured; the entire surface of the fields were covered with the fallen horses and weapons.</span> <span>For 8 days, the Kipchak and Georgian soldiers pursued them up to the limits of the city of Ani. </span> <span>The Persian sultan Malik and il-Ghazi returned with great shame to their own land having narrowly escaped, with not 100 per 1000 remaining.</span> <span>In this year David the Georgian king took the city of Tiflis from the Persians;</span> <span>he violently defeated the city and, impaling 500 men, brutally killed them.</span> <span>In this year, in the month of August, fire fell from the sky and burned the chief mosque which was in the city of Baghdad.</span> <span>Tughril the Persian sultan, brother of Alp Arslan, had built this mosque;</span> <span>it had been built with extraordinary and marvellous craftsmanship.</span> <span>For when he took the Persian land, he fought a great battle for 20 years against the Persian nation,</span> <span>and finally he brought them to submission and took the whole Persian land.</span> <span>He then came to the city of Baghdad and ordered that house of prayer to be built for the Turkish nation lest the Turkish nation enter into an Arab house of prayer</span> <span>And in this year fire fell and burned the Turkish mosque, their filthy house of congregation.</span></p></div>
