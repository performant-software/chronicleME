<div><h3>The year 401 (2 April 952â€“1 April 953)</h3><p><span>Now in those days and in the year 401 there was a severe famine in many places.</span> <span>But in the southern land, in the country of the Muslims, there was great affliction, and most of all in Mesopotamia.</span> <span>And from the harshness of the famine anxiety and trembling arose in many places,</span> <span>and in the renowned mother city of Edessa,</span> <span>which was founded by Tigran the Armenian king.</span> <span>And the famine endured in that country for 5 years and there was immense carnage on account of that famine,</span> <span>and there was great passage in the land of the Muslims.</span> <span>and innumerable Christians died on account of the severity of the famine.</span> <span>And after 5 years locusts arose in that district, like sands of the sea, and ruined the earth.</span> <span>The famine intensified more and more,</span> <span>and many, growing enraged, savagely and mercilessly fell upon and ate each other.</span> <span>The princes and nobility were feeding themselves with grains and berries and there was a great passage of animals.</span> <span>Many villages and districts became depopulated,</span> <span>and nothing else was built up to the time of today.</span></p></div>
