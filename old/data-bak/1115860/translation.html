<div><h3>The year 594 (13 February 1145–12 February 1146)</h3><p><span>After this that murderer Zangi, collecting troops, came to Qal‘at Ja‘bar and put those who were there in dire straits,</span> <span>and, having been killed in the night by his eunuch after one year, he did not become worthy of enjoying the great renown and eternal city of Edessa,</span> <span>which became his prize in the days of the younger Joscelin.</span> <span>who, while he was in line with the will of God, was great and victorious against those who hated Christ, like his father who, in the days of his rule, was glorified by God and by men,</span> <span>and did not have a trench cut for this Christian nation.</span></p></div>
