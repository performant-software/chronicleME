This one was a brave and warlike man; he captured the city of Baghdad and he won three battles against Tap'ar the Persian sultan, who was vanquished. He was of the Rafidhi people and a great blasphemer of Muhammad and all his institutions.  He [had] made camp with his tents in the middle of Ethiopia and in India, and at this time he came to become a son-in-law to il-Ghazi the Persian emir. And in this year Ghazi marched with a multitude of troops and reached the land of Ganjak, going against the land of the Georgians. Then Sultan Malik came to Ganjak with 400,000 mounted warriors, marching with a fearful multitude, and they entered the Georgian land in the region of the city of Tiflis at the mountain called Didgori. When David the Georgian king, son of Bagrat, son of Georgi, heard this, he arrived to battle against the Turkish armies with 40,000 men, skillful and brave and practiced in warfare.

The number of slaughtered Turkish soldiers came to 400,000 and 30,000 men were captured; the entire surface of the fields were covered with the fallen horses and weapons. For 8 days, the Kipchak and Georgian soldiers pursued them up to the limits of the city of Ani.  The Persian sultan Malik and il-Ghazi returned with great shame to their own land having narrowly escaped, with not 100 per 1000 remaining. In this year David the Georgian king took the city of Tiflis from the Persians; he violently defeated the city and, impaling 500 men, brutally killed them. In this year, in the month of August, fire fell from the sky and burned the chief mosque which was in the city of Baghdad. Tughril the Persian sultan, brother of Alp Arslan, had built this mosque; it had been built with extraordinary and marvellous craftsmanship. For when he took the Persian land, he fought a great battle for 20 years against the Persian nation, and finally he brought them to submission and took the whole Persian land. He then came to the city of Baghdad and ordered that house of prayer to be built for the Turkish nation lest the Turkish nation enter into an Arab house of prayer And in this year fire fell and burned the Turkish mosque, their filthy house of congregation." }]
